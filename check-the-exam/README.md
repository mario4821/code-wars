#Check the Exam

The first input array contains the correct answers to an exam, like ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one is "answers" array and contains student's answers.

The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer(empty string).

If the score < 0, return 0.
