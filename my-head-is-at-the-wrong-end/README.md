#My Head Is At The Wrong End

You're at the zoo...all the meerkats look weird. Somthing has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).
